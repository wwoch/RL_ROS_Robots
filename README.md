# Running the Robot Visualization in RViz

To launch the robot visualization in RViz, you need to run the `run_exp_bot.sh` script. This script sets up the necessary environment and configurations for visualizing the robot model in RViz, a 3D visualization tool for ROS (Robot Operating System).

Follow these steps to start the visualization:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `run_exp_bot.sh` script.
3. Make sure the script is executable. If it's not, you can make it executable by running:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run_exp_bot.sh
   ```
4. Run the Script: Execute the script by running:
   ```bash
   bash run_exp_bot.sh
   ```

# Spawning the Robot in Gazebo

To launch the robot in the Gazebo simulator, you need to execute the `run_gazebo_env.sh` script. This script prepares the required environment and settings for simulating the robot model in Gazebo, a dynamic simulation software for robotics applications.

Follow these instructions to start the simulation:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `run_train_env.sh` script.
3. Ensure the script is executable. If it is not, you can make it executable by running:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run_train_env.sh
      ```
4. Run the Script: Execute the script by running:
   ```bash
   bash run_train_env.sh
   ```
